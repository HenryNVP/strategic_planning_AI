== Architecture Styles Applied ==
• Client–Server → Web UI ↔ API Gateway
• Layered → Data → Knowledge → Analysis → Service → UI
• Service-Oriented → Independent services (Agent, Optimizer, EMA, Rules, Governance)
• Pipe & Filter → ETL pipeline (extract → transform → load)
• Batch Sequential → ETL jobs
• Parallel Processing → EMA scenario runs, Optimization solvers
• Framework Layer → LangChain/LangGraph for agent orchestration
